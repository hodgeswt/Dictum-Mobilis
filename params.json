The goal is for Dictum Mobilis to be small and lightweight, storing no info about the user and taking up an extremely small amount of space on the user's phone.\r\n\r\n### Can I Help?\r\nYes, you can! Dictum Mobilis is open-source and on GitHub in a [repository.](https://github.com/hodgeswt/Dictum-Mobilis). Currently, Dictum Mobilis doesn't work due to an [`NSException`.](https://github.com/hodgeswt/Dictum-Mobilis/issues/1). This is the main issue that needs solved before Dictum Mobilis is released.\r\n\r\nIf you contribute to Dictum Mobilis, you agree that you will not receive any royalties from the app if any come to the [main developer and creator.](http://willthodges.weebly.com).\r\n\r\n## Developer\r\n\r\nThe main developer is W.
